An example of a Pig application is the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process that describes how an application extracts data from a data source, transforms the data for querying and analysis purposes, and loads the result onto a target data store. Once Pig loads the data, it can perform projections, iterations, and other transformations. UDFs enable more complex algorithms to be applied during the transformation phase. After the data is done being processed by Pig, it can be stored back in HDFS.
